# Midterm Project: Interactive PC Builder

## Description / Overview
This project is an immersive educational platform designed to guide users through the process of building a personal computer from scratch. By integrating interactive 3D models, step-by-step tutorials, and visual feedback mechanisms, it transforms traditional PC assembly learning into a hands-on digital experience. Users can explore individual components, understand their functions, and follow a structured assembly sequence that mimics real-world practices. The system is ideal for ICT, TVL, and BSIT students who benefit from visual learning and want to gain practical knowledge in hardware setup, compatibility checks, and system integration.

## Objectives
- Understand the roles and functions of essential PC components
- Practice virtual assembly using guided steps and visual aids
- Strengthen technical documentation and Git workflow proficiency
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility and responsive design principles

## Features / Functionality

### 3D Model Viewer
